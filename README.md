# SkimPenny for Chromium browsers
Official chrome extension for SkimPenny

##I really need this price tracker, where can I get it, or know more about it?

The SkimPenny website is currently under construction, and will be mentionned here when ready. 
Want to try it right now? Download the repo as zip, go to chrome://extensions, enable developer mode, and drop the unzipped folder in there. Well done!

For now, supported sites are:
* LDLC.com
* Cdiscount.com
* Conrad.fr
* shop.hardware.fr
* store.nike.com
* grosbill.com

I am very open to any kind of feedback, and if you want to ask for a new store support, just go to the issues tab, and make your request!

Credits go to me, PaulCombal, my friend DMaxence for helping me making the site and providing hosting, and /u/ThePwnter for suggesting the name :)
