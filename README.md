# SkimPenny for Chromium browsers
Official chrome extension for SkimPenny

## I really need this price tracker, where can I get it, or know more about it?

The SkimPenny website is currently under construction, and will be mentionned here when ready. 
If you want to try this extension right now, you can install it [from the play store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/skimpenny-price-tracker/afcdmfdkhghhfgphoalnbpeackpojnla), but be aware that you are an early tester and you will certainly encounter many bugs, we're waiting for your feedback!
