# SkimPenny for Chromium browsers
Official chrome extension for SkimPenny

##I really need this price tracker, where can I get it, or know more about it?

The SkimPenny website is currently under construction, and will be mentionned here when ready. 
If you want to try this extension right now, you can install it [from the play store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/skimpenny-price-tracker/afcdmfdkhghhfgphoalnbpeackpojnla), but be aware that you are an early tester and you will certainly encounter many bugs, we're waiting for your feedback!

For now, supported sites are:
* LDLC.com
* Cdiscount.com
* Conrad.fr
* shop.hardware.fr
* store.nike.com
* grosbill.com
* undiz.com
* romwe.com (non-english only)
* amazon.fr (partial support)

I am very open to any kind of feedback, and if you want to ask for a new store support, just go to the issues tab, and make your request!

Credits go to me, PaulCombal, my friend DMaxence for helping me making the site and providing hosting, and /u/ThePwnter for suggesting the name :)
