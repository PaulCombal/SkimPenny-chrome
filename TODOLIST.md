# TODO LIST:
* Support for multiple currencies for some sites (romwe..)
* Notification on price drop or increase (Requires the next item to be done)
* Update price of favorites automatically when you click on "show graph" or on start (HARD AS FUCK)
* Optimize buildSelectGraph

# This branch only
* make the skimpenny.js page fully functionnal
* understand why I get image 404 inthe first place with background requests
* port all stores to new API

# Next branch
* Use store APIs instead of parsing every HTML page
* make sure we take advantage of schema.org everytime possible

# KNOWN ISSUES:
* Clicking the "Show favorites" button does nothing when the graph is loading
