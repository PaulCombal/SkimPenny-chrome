# TODO LIST:
* Support for multiple currencies for some sites (gearbest, romwe..)
* Make better functions to make sure to remove all anchors and GET parameters to URLS
* Notification on price drop or increase (Requires the next item to be done)
* Update price of favorites automatically when you click on "show graph" or on start (HARD AS FUCK)

# KNOWN ISSUES:
* Clicking the "Show favorites" button does nothing when the graph is loading
