* Notification on price drop or increase (Requires the next item to be done)
* Update price of favorites automatically when you click on "show graph" or on start (HARD AS FUCK)
* Optimize buildSelectGraph

* fix the last time user seen
* make it easier to send simple request in event page
* make the skimpenny.js page fully functionnal
* understand why I get image 404 inthe first place with background requests
