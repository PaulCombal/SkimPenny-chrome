# TODO LIST:
* Support for multiple currencies for some sites (gearbest, romwe..)
* Make better functions to make sure to remove all anchors and GET parameters to URLS
* Notification on price drop or increase
* Update price of favorites automatically when you click on "show graph"
* Get the ID in skimpenny.js, and pass it to popup.js instead of re-finding it

# KNOWN ISSUES:
* Clicking the "Show favorites" button does nothing when the graph is loading
