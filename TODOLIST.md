# TODO LIST:
* Notification on price drop or increase (Requires the next item to be done)
* Update price of favorites automatically when you click on "show graph" or on start (HARD AS FUCK)
* Optimize buildSelectGraph
* Make sure all stores handle background requests correctly

# Next branch
* Use store APIs instead of parsing every HTML page
* make sure we take advantage of schema.org everytime possible

# KNOWN ISSUES:
* Clicking the "Show favorites" button does nothing when the graph is loading
